If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Purple

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
This method does not take the number of listening count. The better way is to add weight to each song according to the number of time it is played.
