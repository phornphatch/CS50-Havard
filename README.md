# CS50 Course Repository

Welcome to my CS50 Course Repository! This repository contains my homework, project assignments, lab notes, and short summaries from the CS50 course I completed in the second half of 2023. 
You can find detailed information about the lectures and assignments in the [CS50x 2023 Syllabus](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/).

***Please don't copy the homework and submit it as your own. Use this as a guideline instead.***
